Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: skov-imx6: switch barebox' environment from MBR to
 GPT
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When barebox is booted from an SD-card the latter is usually not MBR-partitioned
anymore but instead utilizes a GUID partition table today which assigns names to
partitions. This allows for more flexibility as it is independent of a specific
partition number. Chose the name "barebox-environment" for the partition that
shall be used for storing barebox' environment.
