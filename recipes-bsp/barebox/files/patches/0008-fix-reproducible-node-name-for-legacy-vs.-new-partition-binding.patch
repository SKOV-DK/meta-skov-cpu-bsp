the of_reproducible_name mechanism is used to find a partition node
from the barebox devicetree in the Linux devicetree. Unfortunately
we have two different partition bindings. In the legacy one the partition
nodes are directly under the hardware devicenode whereas in the new
binding the partitions are under an additional partitions subnode.
This means we get two different (not so) reproducible names when
the barebox devicetree uses the legacy binding and the Linux devicetree
uses the new binding (or the other way round). To get the same
name then for these cases we drop the partitions subnode from the
reproducible name.

This makes the partition fixup in barebox-state work when the barebox
devicetree uses another binding than the Linux devicetree.
