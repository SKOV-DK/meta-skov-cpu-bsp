Subject: [PATCH 104/110] dts: add nxp,quartz_load_12.5pf to all pcf8523 nodes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add "nxp,quartz_load_12.5pf" to all pcf8523 nodes.

The device tree binding for the pcf8523 now includes
a property "nxp,quartz_load_12.5pf" to specify
that the connected x-tal has an internal capacitance
of 12.5 pF.
Add this to all pcf8523 nodes, because this was implicit before,
at least in the Linux kernel where the driver was hardcoded
to set the rtc to use 12.5 pF.
