Subject: [PATCH] devicetree: fix name of display node
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In barebox starting with DT compiler version 1.4.6 (included since v2018.07.0)
one gets the warning

  /display@di0: node has a unit name, but no reg property

Fix it analogously to barebox' devicetree.
