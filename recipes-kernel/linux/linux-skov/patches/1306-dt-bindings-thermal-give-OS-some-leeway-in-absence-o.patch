Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: thermal: give OS some leeway in absence of
 critical-action

An operating system may allow its user to configure the action to be
undertaken on critical overtemperature events.

However, the bindings currently mandate an absence of the critical-action
property to be equal to critical-action = "shutdown", which would mean
any differing user configuration would violate the bindings.

Resolve this by documenting the absence of the property to mean that the
OS gets to decide.
